    "section": "2.1 Introduction",
    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nYou are very likely already familiar with some aspects of functional program. Let’s start by discussing the two central elements of functional programming: functions and lists.\nThere are several ways that you can structure a program, called programming paradigms. Functional programming is a paradigm that relies exclusively on the evaluation of functions to achieve the desired end result. If you have already written your own functions in the past, what follows will not be very new. But in order to write a good functional program, the functions that you write and evaluate have to have certain properties. Before discussing these properties, let’s start by with state.\n\n2.1.1 The state of your program\nLet’s suppose that you start a fresh R session, and immediately run this next line:\n\nls()\n\nIf you did not modify any of R’s configuration files that get automatically loaded on startup, you should see the following:\n\ncharacter(0)\n\nLet’s suppose that now you load some data:\n\ndata(mtcars)\n\nand define a variable a:\n\na <- 1\n\nRunning ls() now shows the following:\n\n[1] \"a\"      \"mtcars\"\n\nYou have just altered the state of your program. You can think of the state as box that holds everything that gets defined by the user and is accessible at any time. Let’s now define a simple function that prints a sentence:\n\nf <- function(name){\n  print(paste0(name, \" likes lasagna\"))\n}\n\nf(\"Bruno\")\n\nand here’s the output:\n\n[1] \"Bruno likes lasagna\"\n\nLet’s run ls() again:\n\n[1] \"a\"      \"f\"      \"mtcars\"\n\nFunction f() is now listed there as well. This function has two nice properties:\n\nFor a given input, it always returns exactly the same output. So f(\"Bruno\") will always return “Bruno likes lasagna”.\nThis function does not change the state of your program.\n\nLet’s now define another function called g(), that does not have the same properties as f(). First, let’s define a function that does not always return the same output given a particular input:\n\ng <- function(name){\n  food <- sample(c(\"lasagna\", \"cassoulet\", \"feijoada\"), 1)\n  print(paste0(name, \" likes \", food))\n}\n\nFor the same input, “Bruno”, this function now produces (potentially) a different output:\n\ng(\"Bruno\")\n[1] \"Bruno likes lasagna\"\n\n\ng(\"Bruno\")\n[1] \"Bruno likes feijoada\"\n\nAnd now let’s consider function h() that modifies the state of the program:\n\nh <- function(name){\n  food <- sample(c(\"lasagna\", \"cassoulet\", \"feijoada\"), 1)\n\n  if(exists(\"food_list\")){\n    food_list <<- append(food_list, food)\n  } else {\n    food_list <<- append(list(), food)\n  }\n\n  print(paste0(name, \" likes \", food))\n}\n\nThis function uses the <<- operator. This operator saves definitions that are made inside the body of functions in the global environment. Before calling this function, run ls() again. You should see the same objects as before, plus the functions we’ve defined:\n\n[1] \"a\"         \"f\"          \"g\"         \"h\"         \"mtcars\"   \n\nLet’s now run h() once:\n\nh(\"Bruno\")\n[1] \"Bruno likes lasagna\"\n\nAnd now ls() again:\n\n[1] \"a\"         \"f\"         \"food_list\" \"g\"         \"h\"         \"mtcars\" \n\nRunning h() did two things: it printed the message, but also created a variable called “food_list” in the global environment with the following contents:\n\nfood_list\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\nLet’s run h() again:\n\nh(\"Bruno\")\n[1] \"Bruno likes feijoada\"\n\nand let’s check the contents of “food_list”:\n\nfood_list\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"cassoulet\"\n\nIf you keep running h(), this list will continue growing."

    "text": "What Miles said on the matter:\nThere are still a lot of people that find git intimidating and still potential for some things to go badly for a project if git is used in the wrong way. I once had a colleague who assured me they knew how to use git proceed to use a repo like their personal dropbox folder. Perhaps the details of git usage can be basically waved away, but some detail about good git workflow could be incorporated. For example: The branching model to use. IMHO trunk-based development works much better than gitflow for analysis teams. Version number discipline. Why you always bump the version number when making changes to your packages. Why keeping commits small and confined to just one target at a time if possible is useful when tracing problems with a pipeline."

    "text": "5.1 Assertive testing (and defenvise programming?)\nThe analysis is still in Quarto, so how could the readers of this book test their code? Copying here what Miles wrote on the subject:\n‘Assertive programming’ is a topic that might be missing from the book. I think of it as a kind of dual of unit testing. Unit testing is for more generally applicable packaged code. But when you have functions in your analysis pipeline that operate on a very specific kind of input data, unit testing becomes kind of nonsensical because you’re left to dream up endless variations of your input dataset that may never occur. It’s a bit easier to flip the effort to validating the assumptions you have about your input and output data, which you can do in the pipeline functions themselves rather than separate unit testing ones. This is nice because it ensures the validation is performed in the pipeline run, and so is backed by the same reproducibility guarantees.\nI think at the end of the chapter we should hint at unit testing, but leave it as a subsection of the next chapter that deals with packaging code."

To do this well the author needs to make use of certain styles and structures that produce code that has layers of domain specific abstraction a reader can traverse up and down as they build their understanding of the project. Functional programming style, coupled with a dependency graph as per {targets} are useful tools in this regard."
